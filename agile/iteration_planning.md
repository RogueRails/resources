# Iteration Planning Meeting (IPM)

Don't use iteration planning meetings as a "catch-all" for discussions.  To keep conversations to a minimum, timebox a conversation to 5 minutes or less.  If additional discussion is needed, log the details with the story, and move on.  

### Attendees

* Product Manager
* All members of the development team

### Agenda

1. Review completed stories from the previous iteration
2. Review incomplete stories top down: identify "blockers", add/remove acceptance criteria, comments needing attention, re-point if needed
3. Point un-pointed stories in the backlog
4. Reorder stories that need to be re-prioritized due to business need or technical dependency
